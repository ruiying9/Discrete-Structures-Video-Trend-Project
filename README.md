Project Summary:
Our website will encompass US YouTube video data from August 12, 2020, to August 31, 2023. Users can utilize each function and then sort videos by various criteria according to their preference, such as date (from earliest to latest or in reverse order), and by engagement metrics like likes, dislikes, view count, and comment count (from most to least or vice versa). Additionally, our website provides the ability to group videos based on tags and categories. Most importantly the website provides the function to range videos based on the user self defined weight of each component and give videos rate from 0 to 10.

Once the sorting and grouping have been applied, users can access detailed information for each video, including:

- Video ID
- Title
- Published date
- Channel ID
- Channel title
- Category ID
- Trending date
- Tags
- View count
- Likes
- Dislikes
- Comment count
- Thumbnail link
- Comments disabled status
- Ratings disabled status
- Description

Our website offers a comprehensive and user-friendly interface for navigating and interacting with YouTube videos within the specified date range, catering to the diverse preferences and requirements of our users.
Detailed Description of the Application:
The YouTube Video Analytics Dashboard is a powerful tool designed to empower content creators, marketers, and researchers into the vast world of YouTube content. This application addresses the need for comprehensive video data analysis and management, offering a wide range of features to meet various objectives.

In the age of digital content, understanding the performance of different YouTube channels and videos is essential. Creators seek to optimize their content strategies, marketers aim to identify influential videos for partnerships, and researchers want to study trends in user engagement. The YouTube Video Analytics Dashboard aims to solve these challenges by providing easy access to detailed video data.

Key Features include following:

1.Searching: Users can search for videos based on keywords found in the title and description. The search function enhances the website’s usability by allowing users to find videos that match their specific interests or research topics. For instance, if a user searches for "technology reviews" in the application, it will recommend videos related to technology reviews based on their sorting and grouping preferences.

2. Sorting: Users can sort videos by date, allowing them to track trends over time, or by engagement metrics such as likes, dislikes, view count, and comments. This helps identify the most successful videos in any category. Marketers can pinpoint influential videos for collaboration and advertising campaigns

3. Grouping: Videos can be grouped by tags and categories, simplifying the process of identifying content niches and trends within specific genres. Creators can identify trends and best-performing videos within their niche and learn from them.

4.Rating: Users have the option to define the percentage weight of each component (e.g., 20% likes, 0% dislikes, 30% view count, 40% comment count, 10% date from earliest to latest) to influence a video's overall score. This scoring system ranks videos from 0 to 10, with the highest score indicating the best match for the user's preferences. This feature enables highly personalized video recommendations.

5. Detailed Information: For each video, users can access a wealth of information, including video ID, title, publication date, channel information, category, trending date, tags, and engagement statistics. In that case, people can analyze the influence of title, description of content and other characteristics on engagement statistics. Researchers gain access to a wealth of YouTube data for studying user behavior, trends, and content preferences.

Usefulness:

In the evolving landscape of online content, YouTube stands out as a pivotal platform where trends can dictate the global discourse. Several tools, like Social Blade or TubeBuddy, offer insights into YouTube's trending videos, primarily focusing on metrics such as views, likes, and basic channel analytics. These tools, while insightful, often skim the surface, providing content creators and marketers a limited perspective.

Our application offers a distinct advantage by presenting a granular analysis of trending data. Unlike most websites, we integrate various parameters, from likes, dislikes, tags used and comment count to more specific attributes like whether comments or ratings are disabled for videos. While watching, users get to access detailed information such as publication data, channel information, category and so on. Moreover, we offer rating as an advanced function, allowing users to define their own standards of rating videos, and thus making personalizing possible. This holistic approach equips users with an in-depth understanding, making our application not just another analytics tool, but a comprehensive guide to navigating YouTube's trending ecosystem.
Realness of Data:

The dataset we use is from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rsrishav/youtube-trending-video-dataset?resource=download). It has 16 attributes including:
- Video ID
- Title
- Published date
- Channel ID
- Channel title
- Category ID
- Trending date
- Tags
- View count
- Likes
- Dislikes
- Comment count
- Thumbnail link
- Comments disabled status
- Ratings disabled status
- Description

Attributes like trending date, tags, view count, and likes will be instrumental in weighing video’s popularity. 

Functionality of the Website:

Our website serves as a more powerful sorting tool for videos than YouTube itself. While in YouTube users can only sort videos by number of views, time, and rating,  our website provides more than 5 attributes such as number of likes, dislikes, and comment counts.  The website also incorporates categories into the search engine, so that users can easily find videos within categories of their preference. 

The true highlight of our website, however, is its customizable weighting system. Users can assign different weights to video’s metrics such as views, likes/dislikes, comments, etc, to generate ratings for videos that ensures a more tailored searching experience.
